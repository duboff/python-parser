Problem Set 7 @ Intro to Computer Science at MITx. This was done before I learned TDD and proper software design and serves here as a demonstration of python skill. 


Instructions
=============

In problem set 7, you will build a program to monitor news feeds over the Internet. Your program will filter the news, alerting the user when it notices a news story that matches that user's interests (for example, the user may be interested in a notification whenever a story related to the Red Sox is posted).

This problem set has a lot of words, but don't get intimidated! The staff solution has about 80 lines of code; we recommend that the solutions you write for each problem should stay under about 15-20 lines of code (the solutions for some problems will be much shorter than that). If you find yourself writing way more code than that, you should ask for help on the discussion forum and look into alternative ways of implementing things in a simpler way.

We recommend starting early because there is a lot of reading here, but you ought to be able to do this problem set sequentially in the order that we've laid out. There are a lot of references on Python classes available (look for classes in the readings listed in the Reference Links section of the webpage); here is the official Python tutorial on classes, sections 9.1-9.7 (excepting 9.5.1) will be useful for this pset.

OBJECTIVES

The goal of this problem set is to help you become familiar and comfortable with the following topics:

Many facets of object oriented programming, specifically:

* Implementing new classes and their attributes.

* Understanding class methods.

* Understanding inheritance.

* Telling the difference between a class and an instance of that class - recall that a class is a blueprint of an object, whilst an instance is a single, unique unit of a class.

* Utilizing libraries as black boxes.
